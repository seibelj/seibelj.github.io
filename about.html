<p>Currently, I am Co-Founder and CTO of a stealth company in the technology space.</p>

<p>As CTO of <a href="https://recur.com/" target="_blank">RECUR</a>, I scaled the engineering and product organizations from 0 to 100 people, delivered a market-leading consumer and SaaS enterprise NFT platform, and generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue. We were the only cryptocurrency company to execute deals with huge publicly traded businesses including Playtika, Paramount, and Sanrio.</p>

<p>Previously, I was an engineering director providing my services to <a href="https://poloniex.com/" target="_blank">Poloniex</a>, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.</p>

<p>I managed engineering teams at <a href="https://circle.com/" target="_blank">Circle</a>, an industry leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, known for creating the USDC stablecoin.</p>

<p>While CTO at Airfox, I helped orchestrate the first Venture Capital backed Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in Boston,
